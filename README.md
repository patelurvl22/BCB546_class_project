 ## ** Files respresntation :**
 ----
*** PF0001/2/3/4/6/7 :** 
* File name start with PF000 are 6 out of 50 raw files containing 6 columns as follow:
   *  Column#1 and #2 in each file represents amino acids
   *  column #3,4,5 are co-evolution score from each methods as MI, DCA and MIp respectively.
   *  column#6: spatial distance between amino acids
* This files are just testing purpose,upon request structure and raw files can be obtained
* **ROC_AUC_of_each_methods_of 50proteins:** 
* Scripts has ipynb,html and md file for the scripts to obtain ROC, AUC and paired t test plots using python.
* **btm604.pdf**,and **pnas.1111471108-1.pdf :**  
* The scientific paper that we used as reference to evaluate these methods.
